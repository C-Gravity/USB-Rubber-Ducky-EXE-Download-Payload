# USB-Rubber-Ducky-EXE-Download-Payload
I created this USB Rubber Ducky payload a while back and just finnished touching it up a bit. Basically what it does is download malware (created by me) from FileDropper.com. Wondering what the malware does? Well it crashes the target system and deletes all programs and files required for reboot.
